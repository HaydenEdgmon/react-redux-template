This is a basic setup of a react single page application using redux. This project was initialized using create-react-app with redux, react-redux, redux-logger, and redux-thunk installed for implamenting redux. 

## Use

* Clone/download this repo
* install npm packages using
```
npm install
```

From there you're on your own, the commands from create-react-app are still intact, including for building and testing: 
```
npm start //runs a hot reloading dev server on port 3000
npm run build //builds a production build of the application
```
